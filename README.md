# ORM E-Commerce Backend Project

# Hello there! My name is Alex Giannini and this is my E-Commerce ORM Backend project! Using sequelize, mysql, and express, we are able to create a backend to display GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes using the information in the DB. The actual data within this DB is regarding products, categories, and tags. I hope you enjoy!
